Welcome to **Boring.Notch**, the coolest way to make your MacBook's notch the star of the show! Forget about those boring status bars—our notch turns into a dynamic music control center, complete with a snazzy visualizer and all the music controls you need. It's like having a mini concert right at the top of your screen!


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **A MacBook**: With a boring notch (Not Needed).
- **macOS 14.2 or later**: If you’re not on the latest macOS, we might need to send a search party.

   ```

2. **Open the Project in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open boringNotch.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and Run**:
    - Select your target device (MacBook—you do have one, right?).
    - Click the "Run" button or press `Cmd + R`. Watch the magic unfold!

## 🎸 Usage
